Nothing much. Just one night project I made for fun. This is basic, I wouldn't even call it a server, but something that can respond to Minecraft Bedrock edition Unconnected Ping.

From "one night project for fun" this thing now have almost fully working RakNet implementation (ok actually a lot of thing still have to be done) and it can also process Bedrock packets (at least should, hard to test because it's not possible to have stable connection with Minecraft yet).

**Update 2024.08.18**
It is now possible to join the server. I actually didn't think that I will make it so far but it happened.
